# Source code for the web interface

This is only the source files. To have the interface running, you need to follow this steps:

First at all, you need to have **npm** installed.
Then, somewhere on your laptop, execute the following commands:
1. `npm install -g create-react-app`
2. `create-react-app my-app`

3. `cd my-app`

4. `npm start`

It will open in your browser your web app.

Finally, replace the files in the **src** folder of your web app (in **my-app**) by the ones in this repo.
