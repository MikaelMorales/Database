# Database Systems

The dataset contains data about comic books.</br>
We analyzed the dataset and extract the Entity-Relationship schema, then we fully cleaned the dataset and created the necessary tables to represent the data as best as possible. Finally, we provided a user-friendly interface to manage the data.</br>
The project has been built with MySQL, PhP servers & a Web-App written with ReactJs to allow the users to search and/or manage the database without writting a single SQL line.
